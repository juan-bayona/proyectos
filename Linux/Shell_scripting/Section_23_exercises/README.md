Hello,

This are the exercises for the videos on section 23 for the Linux and bash course. These were 
done by myself using logic, no chatgpt was used on them as I like thinking first and if 
definitively I do not know, I look into my notes. As last resource, I ask chatGpt not the whole
exercise but a clue.

Thank you.
